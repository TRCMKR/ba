# ba

BA stands for *Bibliotheca Alexandrina* (Latin, Library of Alexandria) – the most famous library of the ancient world.

> We can roam the bloated stacks of the Library of Alexandria, where all imagination and knowledge are assembled;   
> we can recognize in its destruction the warning that all we gather will be lost,   
> but also that much of it can be collected again...
> - Alberto Manguel
